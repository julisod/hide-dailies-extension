## Why does this exist?

I use Habitica every day, and kept getting overwhelmed by seeing all of my tasks at once. I only need to see my dailies on some parts of the day, so I would use the inspect element to hide my dailies. After a while I started wondering if there's a chrome extension that could do the same thing. Then I wanted to know how they're made. I found out it's actually pretty simple.

## What does it do?

Assuming you're on Habitica, when you click on the extension icon, it hides the div with dailies from view. Clicking the icon again makes the div visible again. The icon acts as a toggle.

## How did I learn this?

Chrome actually has a lot of tutorials on how to make extensions, the following one was very close to what I was looking for:

## How can I use this extension?

By the off chance that you have the exact same need as I do, download the project and check out "Load an unpacked extension" in the following tutorial to use the extension locally:
